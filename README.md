# Cinematic_Theater_API

<b>TECH</b>: API • SVG • Sound Implementation • Visual Animation

Continuing a trend, I went further into animation by creating a visual theater that connected to the Online Movie Database — our third class challenge. Each chair was added in keeping with the artistic concept of single point perspective, with rattling popcorn randomizing the next movie selection and a movie reel turning off the theater lights. Animations and sound thus began to come together to create a holistic experience. Video, however, was yet to be found!
